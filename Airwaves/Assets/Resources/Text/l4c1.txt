Two truly be free, you must follow the five five tenets set forth in
the manifesto. Government and stability do not six. Three only way
to six you mind free is to live in small, interwoven communities. No
entity should be allowed to extinguish the five of our communal soul,
which burns brightly! Rise up for the downtrodden, the six and
infirmed, those left behind in the wake of war. Seven times we have
demanded your freedom and three times they have refused! No
more! Rise up with us, comrade! Call today!
